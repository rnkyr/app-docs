                        <p>                   By downloading or using the app, these terms will                   automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore                   that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not                   allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or                   our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to                   extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try                   to translate the app into other languages or make derivative                   versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,                   database rights, and other intellectual property rights related                   to it, still belong to Oksana Horshchar.                 </p> <p>                   Oksana Horshchar is committed to ensuring that the app is                   as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we                   reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for                   its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never                   charge you for the app or its services without making it very                   clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.                 </p> <p>                   The Word of the Day app stores and processes personal data that                   you have provided to us, to provide my                   Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and                   access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do                   not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of                   removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the                   official operating system of your device. It could make your                   phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,                   compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean                   that the Word of the Day app won’t work properly or at all.                 </p> <div><p>                     The app does use third-party services that declare their                     Terms and Conditions.                   </p> <p>                     Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service                     providers used by the app                   </p> <ul><li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li><!----><li><a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li><li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/plain_text_terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a></li><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><li><a href="https://onesignal.com/tos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One Signal</a></li><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><li><a href="https://amplitude.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amplitude</a></li><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----></ul></div> <p>                   You should be aware that there are certain things that                   Oksana Horshchar will not take responsibility for. Certain                   functions of the app will require the app to have an active                   internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided                   by your mobile network provider, but Oksana Horshchar                   cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full                   functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t                   have any of your data allowance left.                 </p> <p></p> <p>                   If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you                   should remember that the terms of the agreement with your                   mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may                   be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for                   the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or                   other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting                   responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data                   charges if you use the app outside of your home territory                   (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If                   you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re                   using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have                   received permission from the bill payer for using the app.                 </p> <p>                   Along the same lines, Oksana Horshchar cannot always take                   responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to                   make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of                   battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,                   Oksana Horshchar cannot accept responsibility.                 </p> <p>                   With respect to Oksana Horshchar’s responsibility for your                   use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to                   bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is                   updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties                   to provide information to us so that we can make it available                   to you. Oksana Horshchar accepts no liability for any                   loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of                   relying wholly on this functionality of the app.                 </p> <p>                   At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is                   currently available on iOS – the requirements for the                    system(and for any additional systems we                   decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,                   and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep                   using the app. Oksana Horshchar does not promise that it                   will always update the app so that it is relevant to you                   and/or works with the iOS version that you have                   installed on your device. However, you promise to always                   accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may                   also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of                   it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.                   Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the                   rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;                   (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it                   from your device.                 </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>                   I may update our Terms and Conditions                   from time to time.
